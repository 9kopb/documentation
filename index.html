  <p>This describes the resources that make up the BlockCypher API. If you have any problem or request please <a href="mailto:contact@blockcypher.com">contact us</a>.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The BlockCypher API is a simple JSON API that can be accessed over HTTP or HTTPS from the api.blockcypher.com domain. It tries to adhere to the REST principles as much as possible and all URLs are versioned. In addition to straight HTTP APIs we also provide push-style APIs using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets">websockets</a> and <em>web hooks</em>. Web hooks let you register a URL that we will POST to anytime an event you're interested in happens.<p>

  <p>Most of our resources exist under a given blockchain resource. For example the complete URL to the Bitcoin main blockchain is:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-http">https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main</code></pre>

  <p>Opening that URL in your browser will produce the following JSON document, showing the current height of the chain as well as the hashes and URLs of that last 2 blocks (note that this is actually extracted in real time from our API).</p>
  <pre class="language-javascript" data-src="http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main"></pre>

  <p>The examples and samples in this documentation are in Javascript (browser or node.js) or using the command line. More samples will be added over time and complete examples can be fund in our <a href="https://github.com/blockcypher/documentation">Github documentation repository</a>. For the command line, we recommend using <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zpoley/json-command">json</a>. While installing them isn't required to get started, we will be using them in this documentation to illustrate some usage patterns. Like this little piece of magic showing the number of transactions in the latest block (see the Blockchain API section for more information):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -s http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main | json latestUrl | xargs curl -s | json n_tx
267</code></pre>
  <p></p>

  <h1>Blockchain API</h1>
  <p>The Blockchain API gives you access to the raw information that makes up the blockchain: blocks and transactions. If those concepts aren't familiar, refer to the Bitcoin wiki for more information about <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction">transactions</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Blocks">blocks</a>.
  <p>Three main resources make up the Blockchain API (all located under https://api.blockcypher.com).</p>

    </tr>
    </tbody>

  <h2>Chains</h2>
  <p>The only supported blockchain at the moment is the Bitcoin main blockchain. We plan to add addition blockchains and altcoins depending on popularity and demands. If you would like us to consider adding one, please <a href="mailto:contact@blockcypher.com">contact us</a>.</p>
  <p>A request to a given chain returns the following properties:</p>
  <table>

  <h2>Blocks</h2>
  <p>Blocks are located under a chain's URL space, their main function is to group validated transactions together. The most interesting properties of blocks are listed below. Additional, lower-level properties are also included, if you're interested in them please refer to documentation on the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm">block hashing algorithm</a>.
