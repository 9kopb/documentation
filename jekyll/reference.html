  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>BlockCypher runs the Main and Test Bitcoin and Litecoin block chains as well as the Uro block chain. The BlockCypher API is a simple, mostly RESTful JSON API, accessed over HTTP or HTTPS from the api.blockcypher.com domain. All URLs are versioned. We provide push-style APIs using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> and allow you to register a URL to POST to via <a href="https://webhooks.pbworks.com/w/page/13385124/FrontPage">WebHooks</a>.
	<p>Please <a href="mailto:contact@blockcypher.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions.</p>
  <p>Most resources exist under a given block chain. The URLs to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Uro and BlockCypher chains are:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-http">https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main
https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/test3
https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/ltc/main
https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/uro/main
https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/bcy/test</code></br></pre>

  <p>Opening the URL to Bitcoin Main will produce the following JSON document. It will show the current chain height, hashes and URLs of the last 2 blocks which are extracted in <i>real-time</i> from our API.</p>
  <pre class="language-javascript" data-src="http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main"></pre>

  <p>The samples in this documentation are in Javascript (browser or node.js) or can be accessed using the command line. Complete examples can be found in BlockCypher's <a href="https://github.com/blockcypher/documentation">Github documentation repository</a>. For the command line, we use <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zpoley/json-command">json</a> to illustrate. 
	
	<p>For example, this shows the number of transactions in the latest block (see the <a href="#blockchain-api">Blockchain API</a> section for more information):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -s http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main | json latest_url | xargs curl -s | json n_tx
267</code></pre>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="rate_limits"></a>
  <h2>Rate Limits</h2>
  <p>BlockCypher APIs can be used up to these rate limits: 
	<ul class="list">
	  <li>Classic requests, up to 5 requests/sec and 600 requests/hr</il>
  	<li>WebHooks and WebSockets, up to 600 requests/hr</li>
	</ul>
  <p>If you exceed a limit, an HTTP status code 429 will be returned. Please <a href="mailto:contact@blockcypher.com">email us</a> for a user token if your usage will exceed those limits, we'll email you one within minutes. Our future pricing plan will be tiered based on usage and volume. We will have a free tier and an extended free plan for our early users. </p>
  <p>When you have a token, just pass it as a URL parameter to every single of youre requests, for example:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-http">https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main?token=$USER_TOKEN</code></pre>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="testing"></a>
  <h2>Testing</h2>
  <p>To facilitate the testing of your application when using BlockCypher's API, we provide our own test blockchain that supports all of our web services. This blockchain has characteristics very similar to Bitcoin's main chain and a "faucet", which allows you to very easily get free coins for automated testing.</p>
  <p>The only differences with the Bitcoin main chain are the following:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>The chain is private (no data is broadcasted, only BlockCypher mines the transactions), making it much more predictable than the Bitcoin's testnet (which is frequently under attack).</li>
    <li>New blocks get built every minute, confirming the transactions that have been created using our <a href="##creating_transactions">transaction API</a>.</li>
    <li>The prefix for standard addreses is 'B' or 'C'. The prefix for multisig addresses is 'D'.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This blockchain is available under the following URL:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-http">https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/bcy/test</code></br></pre>
  <p>In addition to all our APIs, a faucet endpoint is available. Calling it passing an address will automatically create a new transaction funding the address with the provided amount. For example to create a new test address and fund it with 100,000 of our coins:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -X POST http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/bcy/test/addrs?token=$TOKEN
{
  "private": "26415016a2fb49f51aef161cb35bd537be07b75a6ac1e297d3b7a370cc85433b",
  "public": "02c572d062fefcc8c3e1bf5016450addcedb89cd7e4507d8a323f327b4ad1018e0",
  "address": "CFqoZmZ3ePwK5wnkhxJjJAQKJ82C7RJdmd"
}
$ curl -d '{"address": "CFqoZmZ3ePwK5wnkhxJjJAQKJ82C7RJdmd", "amount": 100000}' http://api.blockcypher.com/v1/bcy/test/faucet?token=$TOKEN
{
    "tx_ref": "02dbf5585d438a1cba82a9041dd815635a6b0df684225cb5271e11397a759479"
}</code></pre>
  <p>A token is required to use the faucet. The faucet will refuse to fund an address with more than 50 billion coins and will not fund more than 10 million coins at a time.</p>
  <p>Of course, you can still test your applications against the Bitcoin testnet. Our test blockchain just provides more stability and a reliable automated faucet.</p>

<h1>Blockchain API</h1>
  <p>The Blockchain API allows you to access raw data from the block chain's <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction">transactions</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Blocks">blocks</a>.

  <p>Three main resources make up the Blockchain API (all GETs under https://api.blockcypher.com):</p>

  <h2>Transactions</h2>
  <p>Transactions can be confirmed into a block, in a pool of non-confirmed transactions, or orphaned. Confirmed transactions transfer a certain amount of bitcoin from previous <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions">transactions</a> (referenced by inputs and controlled by a set of addresses) to a set of target <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address">addresses</a>.</p>

  <p>Inputs and outputs rely on scripts. When executed, they define if the transaction is valid and what type of transaction it is. We recognize 6 types of transaction scripts:</p>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>Pay-to-pubkey-hash (most common transaction transferring to a public key hash)</li>
    <li>Pay-to-multi-pubkey-hash (multi-signatures transaction)</li>
    <li>Pay-to-pubkey (used for mining transactions)</li>
    <li>Pay-to-script-hash (used for transactions relying on arbitrary scripts, rarely used)</li>
    <li>Null-data, sometimes called op-return (used to embed small chunks of data in the block chain)</li>
    <li>Empty (no script present, mostly used for the input of a mining transaction)</li>
    <li>Unknown (non-standard script)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Zero Confirmations and Double Spending</h2>
  <p>To help you deal with zero confirmation (aka unconfirmed) transactions and the risk of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">double spending</a>, we provide 2 additional transaction properties:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><b>receive_count</b>: the number of nodes in the bitcoin network we've received that transaction from so far, indicates how many nodes, at the minimum, accepted this transaction.</li>
    <li><b>confidence</b>: the percentage chance (between 0 and 1) that a transaction will make it into a block over time, which accounts for double-spend or transaction loss. Note that it doesn't indicate <em>how fast</em> the confirmation will happen.</li>
    <li><b>preference</b>: level of preference miners will have to include this transaction in their block, a high preference means the transaction is very likely to be confirmed in the next block, a low preference means it's likely to take several blocks (&gt;6).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The confidence is calculated based on elapsed time as well as the receive count and is based on several public research results.</p>
  <p>In addition, 2 other properties indicate when a double-spend has been detected:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><b>double_spend</b>: a boolean indicating whether this transaction is a double spend.</li>
    <li><b>double_spend_tx</b>: the hash of the other transaction involved in the double spend attempt.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These properties are added to any unconfirmed transactions when retrieved either through the blockchain API or the address API. To be notified when a double spending attempt occurs, also see our <a href="#events">double spend webhook</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, note that these measures are mitigation strategies you can rely on if you need fast transaction confirmations. They're not a bulletproof way to secure unconfirmed transactions and double spending attacks, even extremely unlikely, can still occur. Block chain confirmations ultimately provide the highest level of security.</p>

  <h1>Payments and Forwarding</h1>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="payments_summary"></a>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Our payment API is the easiest way to accept payments securely without the need to create accounts for your users. It's also a generic way to automatically transfer value from one address to another. The 2 main use cases are:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Generate payment-specific addresses for which funds will automatically transfer to a main merchant address.</li>
    <li>Easily fund a multisig address from any wallet by providing a using a classic address that will automatically transfer to the multisig.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Payments are free (other than the required 0.1 mBTC miner fee).</p>
  <p>To create a new payment forwarding:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">POST https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/payments
{
  "destination": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "callback_url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/new-block"
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>
  <p>This will return the same document, adding the input address the payment should be directed to:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "input_address": "16uKw7GsQSzfMaVTcT7tpFQkd7Rh9qcXWX",
  "destination": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "callback_url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/payments",
  "id": "399d0923-e920-48ee-8928-2051cbfbc369",
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>
  <p>Any money sent to 16uKw... will from then on be automatically transferred to 15qx9... In addition, the <em>callback_url</em> will be invoked with a POST request anytime a payment is made, providing a payment summary:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "value": 100000000,
  "input_address": "16uKw7GsQSzfMaVTcT7tpFQkd7Rh9qcXWX",
  "input_transaction_hash": "39bed5d007d7ccf3ff0c150b580bc73d6f7e8c988063953da3ef964761b28b0d",
  "transaction_hash": "1aa6103d8dfc067ad42c4b9a5b157d0fc403b85064d852abbc162bb274cd9def"
}</code></pre>
  <p>All payments will be debited with a 10,000 satoshis mining fee.</p>
  <p>A quick and easy way to test payments is to use curl to create a simple one without a callback (replace with your own address):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -d '{"destination": "17astdTmG8zzVmry8mV8A7atAr3XefEgRX"}' https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/payments</code></pre>
  <p>Send some money to the returned <em>input_address</em> and watch it being instantly forwarded to your desintation address.</p>

  <h1>Creating Transactions</h1>
  <p>For security reasons we do not keep any private keys: you are the only one who can sign transactions. There are 2 ways to send a transaction using our API:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Build the transaction yourself (using a 3rd party library) and push the raw hex-encoded string. We will broadcast to the network and track it for you.</li>
    <li>Create the transaction with our API, the 2 addresses and the amount.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using our API, creating a transaction from scratch is a 3-step process:</p>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>We build the unsigned transaction and the data to sign it from basic information: an input address, an output address, and the value transferred.</li>
    <li>You sign the transaction data.</li>
    <li>We finish building the transaction, broadcast it over the peer-to-peer network, and send it back to you.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is accomplished with two simple POST requests and a third one which allows you to push raw hexadecimal transactions:</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>URL Pattern</th><th>Example</th><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>New</td><td>/v1/{coin}/{chain}/txs/new</td><td>/v1/btc/main/txs/new</a><td>POST</td></td>
      <td>Takes transaction information and returns a partially built transaction with the data to sign.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Send</td><td>/v1/{coin}/{chain}/txs/send</td>
      <td>/v1/btc/main/txs/send</td><td>POST</td>
      <td>Takes the partially built transaction, signed data and public keys. Returns the completed transaction and transmits it over the network.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Push</td><td>/v1/{coin}/{chain}/txs/push</td>
      <td>/v1/btc/main/txs/push</td><td>POST</td>
      <td>If you're already building your own signed transaction, allows you to validate them and transmit them over the network. Takes the transaction's hex-encoded string in a {"tx": "12A45F67..."} JSON wrapper.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>When a transaction has been successfully sent (using the Send or Push endpoints), an HTTP status of 201 is returned.</p>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="transaction_skeleton"></a>
  <h2>Transaction Skeleton</h2>
  <p>A partially filled transaction is needed to create a full transaction. We require at least one input with a minimum of one address and at least one output with an address and value (in satoshis). For example:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "inputs": [
    {"addresses": ["181w71oR7nTEsKducLBTUJkdbTvLDQzymL"]}
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"addresses": ["1FGAsJFNgWvFz2tWQAnRq8S6fVX9Zmuxje"], "value": 4000000000}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

  <p>We build the full set of inputs using unspent transactions from the input address and fill up a temporary, unsigned transaction. Passing a negative value (like -1) will automatically generate a <em>sweep</em>, transferring the entire balance of the input address (minus potential fees).</p>
  <p>By default, we allow spending from unconfirmed transactions. So unconfirmed transactions may be used as inputs of your transactions. To disable spending from unconfirmed transactions and force the selection of only confirmed inputs, provide a "confirmations" property of value 1.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "confirmations": 1,
  "inputs": [
    {"addresses": ["181w71oR7nTEsKducLBTUJkdbTvLDQzymL"]}
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"addresses": ["1FGAsJFNgWvFz2tWQAnRq8S6fVX9Zmuxje"], "value": 4000000000}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

  <p>The document returned by a call to new uses the following format:</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Example (abbreviated URLs and hashes)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>errors</td><td>[{"error": ""Address 1DEP... with balance 4271116 does not have enough funds to transfer 500000000."}]</td>
      <td>Array of errors encountered while generating the transaction. If the generation is successful, nothing will appear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tx</td><td>tx: {...}</td>
      <td>Temporary transaction, fully filled up except for the input scripts (requires signature).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tosign</td><td>["04779733bb...", "0396ea6f1b..."]</td>
      <td>Array of hexadecimal-encoded data to sign, one for each generated input.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(signatures)</td><td>["bcd2c363a2...", "dc621478..."]</td>
      <td>Array of hexadecimal-encoded signatures you need to provide.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(pubkeys)</td><td>["02c8d29d...", "02c8d29d..."]</td>
      <td>The public key for each generated input (in general, repeat the public key corresponding to the provided input address).</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Note that low <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees">transaction fees</a> are automatically included as required to ensure your transaction will be relayed.</p>
  <p>Since the transaction is not yet complete yet, the transaction hash is a temporary one. The final hash will be calculated and returned with the completed transaction.</p>
  <p>You may also provide inputs filled from the <em>prev_hash</em> and <em>output_index</em> properties. In this case, we use your inputs as provided and will not attempt to generate them from the address. Fees and change will still be inserted appropriately.</p>
  <p>Finally, additional control over the generated script can be achieved by setting the <em>script_type</em> property, in particular for multisig outputs (which are pay-to-script-hash).</p>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>pay-to-pubkey-hash (most common transaction transferring to a public key hash)</li>
    <li>pay-to-multi-pubkey-hash (multi-signatures transaction)</li>
    <li>pay-to-pubkey (used for mining transactions)</li>
    <li>pay-to-script-hash (used for transactions relying on arbitrary scripts, rarely used)</li>
    <li>null-data, sometimes called op-return (used to embed small chunks of data in the block chain)</li>
    <li>empty (no script present, mostly used for the input of a mining transaction)</li>
    <li>unknown (non-standard script)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>The following example will create 2 inputs because 2 previous transactions must be used for the requested amount. It also creates 2 outputs, one for the required transaction and another for the change.</p>

  <h2>Signing and Sending</h2>
  <p>Use your private key(s) to sign each of the data strings provided (decode them to byte arrays and use ECDSA). Return the signatures as hex-encoded strings in a <em>signatures</em> array property inserted in the previous document.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "tx": { ... },
  "tosign": [
    "04779733bba8085dd86c21d86c8f9e786a1124751c42061d4c539229a07c4464",

  ]
}</code></pre>

  <p>Additionally, for each input the public key matching the input address must be provided because the input address cannot be calculated from the address. In general, repeat the public key for the address provided in the transaction skeleton input.</p>
  <p>Here's an example showing how to sign the transaction in Javascript using the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib">bitcoinjs</a> library:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var key     = Bitcoin.ECKey.fromHex(source.private);
  var pubkeys = [];
  var signatures = newtx.tosign.map(function(tosign) {
    pubkeys.push(source.public);
    return bytesToHex(key.sign(hexToBytes(tosign)));
  });
  newtx.signatures  = signatures;
  newtx.pubkeys     = pubkeys;
</pre></code>

  <p>Once signatures are inserted, POST the resulting document to the send resource (under /v1/{coin}/{chain}/txs/send). The same document will be returned with the finalized transaction. If no errors are returned, your transaction was successfully issued and broadcasted across the network.</p>

  <p>See our <a href="/samples/create-tx.html">full sample</a> to issue a transaction on testnet from your browser.</p>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="error_handling"></a>
  <h2>Error Handling</h2>
  <p>When something is wrong with the provided transaction, the server will reply with a 400 HTTP error code. It will also return a JSON document that includes the transaction and an <i>errors</i> section listing the different issues that were encountered. If you're experiencing any difficulty, please check the returned errors.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "tx": { ... },
  "errors": [
    {"error": "..."}
  ]
}</code></pre>

  <p>The most common issue is the absence of confirmed unspent outputs to build the transaction from. By default, spending unconfirmed transactions isn't enabled, so you may not be able to issue a 2nd transaction until the first has been confirmed. To enable spending from unconfirmed transactions, in the partially filled transaction provided to the new endpoint add "confirmations: -1".</p>
  <p>The second most common issue is to use uncompressed public keys when compressed public keys were used to generate the address. If the script generated can't be verified, try passing compressed public keys instead.</p>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="multisig"></a>
<h2>Multisig Transactions</h2>

<p>Our multiple signature transaction API works similarly to our classic <a href="#creating_transactions">transaction API</a> with a few differences:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>A script type of multisig-N-of-M must be set (with N and M replaced by actual numbers, like multisig-2-of-3).</li>
  <li>Public keys must be provided instead of addresses for the multisig inputs or outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a multisig interaction to happen, first the multisig address has to be sent some money using a transaction that includes N public keys in its output. Then that transaction can be spent by another by repeatedly issuing the required M number of signature. The interaction can be broken down as follows:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Call the <a href="#transaction_skeleton">txs/new</a> endpoint to create a funding transaction. For a 2-of-3 transaction:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "inputs": [{"addresses": [sourceAddr]}],
    "outputs": [{
      "addresses"   : [pubkey1, pubkey2, pubkey3],
      "script_type" : "multisig-2-of-3",
      "value"       : 250000,
    }]
  }</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#signing_sending">Sign the returned hex string</a> and post it with the transaction to txs/send. The multisig address is now funded.</li>
</ol>
<p>To spend the previous transaction, each party (e.g., 3 in a 3-of-4 multisig) needs to send a new signed multisig transaction, specifying the public keys and script_type for input and the receiving address as output:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Call the txs/new endpoint to create the spending transaction. For example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "inputs": [{
    "addresses"   : [pubkey1, pubkey2, pubkey3],
    "script_type" : "multisig-2-of-3"
  }],
  "outputs": [{
    "addresses" : [destAddr],
    "value"     : 150000
  }]
}</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#signing_sending">Sign the returned hex string</a> and post it with the transaction to txs/send. We correlate each call based on the pubkeys/destination/amount and will send the transaction automatically once we have enough signatures.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>Alternatively, instead of having each party call our API, you may also share the hex string to sign and provide the required signatures all at once. Note that in all cases, the order in which the public keys are provided matters and should be consistent, as required for Bitcoin P2SH transactions. Remaining funds (change) will be sent back to the multisig address.</p>
	
<p>See our <a href="/samples/multisig-tx.html">full Javascript sample</a> for how to issue a 2 out of 3 multisig transaction.</p>

<p>Note: if you're using a blockexplorer to check a transaction, be aware that blockchain.info does not support pay-to-script transactions and will not show the transaction until it's confirmed.</p>
	
  <a class="title-anchor" id="websocket_webhook"></a>
  <h1>WebSockets and WebHooks</h1>
  <a class="title-anchor" id="events"></a>
  <h2>Events</h2>
  <p>Crypto-currencies are highly transactional systems. Usage patterns require knowing when an event occurs: e.g., when a transaction is included into a block get its first confirmation. We provide push APIs to facilitate those use cases (instead of polling resources).</p>
  <p>We support both WebSockets and WebHooks:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> - used typically in client applications when a web server is not already running: e.g., a web page displaying the most recent transactions or a wallet app updating its UI when a transaction has been confirmed. Websockets are less reliable in longer interactions (over several hours) because they require a connection to stay open.</li> 
    <li><a href="https://webhooks.pbworks.com/w/page/13385124/FrontPage">WebHooks</a> - the most reliable way to get notified but requires running a web server to receive the calls. We automatically retry HTTP requests 3 times.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both WebSockets and WebHooks can forward the following events:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><em>unconfirmed-tx</em>: Triggered for every new transaction before it goes into a block; basically, for every unconfirmed transactions. The payload is the unconfirmed <a href="#transactions">transaction</a>.</li>
    <li><em>new-block</em>: Triggered for every new block added to the main chain. The payload is the <a href="#blocks">block</a>.</li>
    <li><em>confirmed-tx</em>: Triggered for every new transaction making it into a new block on the main chain; basically, for every first transaction confirmation. This is equivalent to listening to the above events and fetching each transaction in the block. The payload is the confirmed <a href="#transactions">transaction</a>.</li>
    <li><em>tx-confirmation</em>: Simplifies listening to confirmations on all transactions on a given address up to a provided threshold (maximum 10, default 6). Use the "confirmations" property to specify the number of confirmations desired.</li>
    <li><em>double-spend-tx</em>: Triggered any time a double spend is detected. The payload is the transaction that triggered the even and the hash of the transaction that it's trying to double spend is included in its <em>double_spend_tx</em> property.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To subscribe to an event, send a document with the following format:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "event": "unconfirmed-tx",
  "address": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "token": "b972c4c0-180f-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66"
}</code></pre>
  <p>The token is optional and is the value we provide you (see <a href="#rate_limits">rate limits</a>). Currently supported properties are:</p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>event</td><td>"event": "new-block"</td>
      <td>Type of event to receive. See above for the supported event types.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hash</td><td>"hash": "346a5...b77e5" (abbreviated)</td>
      <td>Only objects with a matching hash will be sent. The hash can either be for a block or a transaction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>address</td><td>"address": "1CjPR7Z5ZSyWk6WtXvSFgkptmpoi4UM9BC"</td>
      <td>Only transactions associated with the given address will be sent.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>script</td><td>"script": "pay-to-script-hash"</td>
      <td>Only transactions with an output script of the provided type will be sent. The recognized types of scripts are: pay-to-pubkey-hash, pay-to-multi-pubkey-hash, pay-to-pubkey, pay-to-script-hash, null-data (sometimes called OP_RETURN), empty or unknown.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Depending on the provided properties, the message content will be either a transaction or a block.</p>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="websockets"></a>
  <h2>WebSockets</h2>
  <p>Opening a WebSocket to listen to our feeds is easy:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">new WebSocket("ws://socket.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main");</code></pre>
  <p>The code may differ if you're not programming in Javascript but the URL will be identical. Once the socket is opened, the JSON document describing the event of interest should be sent.</p>
  <p>In addition to standard events, websockets accept a <em>ping</em> event. If you send the following, you will receive the same message back with "ping" replaced by "pong":</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "event": "ping"
}</code></pre>
  <p>A regular ping (i.e. every 20 seconds) allows the websocket to stay connected for a longer period of time.</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>In this example, using a WebSocket, we will subscribe to all pooled transactions (new transactions that have not been confirmed). We open a new WebSocket and send the filter we're interested in. Upon notification of new transactions, we format them and add them into the page.</p>

  <pre data-src="{{ "js/samples/browser-websocket.js" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"></pre>
  <button class="tryme btn btn-primary" type="button" id="browser-websocket">Try me!</button>

  <a class="title-anchor" id="webhooks"></a>
  <h2>WebHooks</h2>
  <p>WebHooks have the same interaction format but with two key differences:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>The JSON document describing the event subscription should be sent using a POST request to https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/hooks and include an additional property containing the URL to be called.</li>
    <li>The transaction or block associated with the event you subscribed to will be POSTed to the provided URL. The POST request will also include a X-EventType HTTP header specifying the type of event which triggered the request.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See <a href="#events">above</a> for all the different type of events you can listen to with a WebHook. To create a new WebHook:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">POST https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/hooks
{
  "event": "new-block",
  "url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/new-block"
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>

  <p>To secure the endpoint at the callback URL you give to us and prevent a potential attacker from calling it, we recommend you append a secret as a URL parameter to that URL. We will call you leaving the URL unchanged, which allows you to test for that parameter. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>https://my.domain.com/api/callbacks/doublespend?secret=justbetweenus</code></pre>
  <p>The use of https is also recommended to prevent eavesdropper from potentially capturing the secret.</p>

  <p>A simple way to test a WebHook is to use curl and <a href="http://requestb.in/">requestb.in</a>. First go to <a href="http://requestb.in/">requestb.in</a> and create a new bin. Then use curl to create a BlockCypher WebHook that will POST to your bin. For example to get every new block:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"event":"new-block", "url": "http://requestb.in/YOUR_BIN"}' https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/hooks</code></pre>

  <p>For an example of using WebHooks written in node.js, refer to our <a href="https://github.com/blockcypher/documentation/blob/gh-pages/samples/nodejs-webhook.js">sample</a>.</p>

  <p>If calling the URL configured in a WebHook fails, it will be retried 3 times. If a WebHook fails to deliver 50 distinct events, the WebHook will be disabled.</p>
