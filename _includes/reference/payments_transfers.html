<h3 class="text-purple">Summary</h3>

<p>Our payment API is the easiest way to accept payments securely without the need to create accounts for your users. It's also a generic way to automatically transfer value from one address to another. The 2 main use cases are:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Generate payment-specific addresses for which funds will automatically transfer to a main merchant address.</li>
  <li>Easily fund a multisig address from any wallet by providing a using a classic address that will automatically transfer to the multisig.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not take a fee on payment forwarding, (other than the required 0.1 mBTC miner fee), payments are free. However as part of your own services, you can include a fee that will also be automatically transfered to your own address in the same transaction.</p>

<p>To create a basic payment forwarding:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">POST https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/payments
{
  "destination": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "callback_url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/new-block"
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>

<p>This will return the same document, adding the input address the payment should be directed to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "input_address": "16uKw7GsQSzfMaVTcT7tpFQkd7Rh9qcXWX",
  "destination": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "callback_url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/payments",
  "id": "399d0923-e920-48ee-8928-2051cbfbc369",
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>

<p>Any money sent to 16uKw... will from then on be automatically transferred to 15qx9... In addition, the <em>callback_url</em> will be invoked with a POST request anytime a payment is made, providing a payment summary:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "value": 100000000,
  "input_address": "16uKw7GsQSzfMaVTcT7tpFQkd7Rh9qcXWX",
  "input_transaction_hash": "39bed5d007d7ccf3ff0c150b580bc73d6f7e8c988063953da3ef964761b28b0d",
  "transaction_hash": "1aa6103d8dfc067ad42c4b9a5b157d0fc403b85064d852abbc162bb274cd9def"
}</code></pre>

<p>All payments will be debited with a 10,000 satoshis mining fee.</p>

<p>A quick and easy way to test payments is to use curl to create a simple one without a callback (replace with your own address):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl -d '{"destination": "17astdTmG8zzVmry8mV8A7atAr3XefEgRX"}' https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/payments</code></pre>

<p>Send some money to the returned <em>input_address</em> and watch it being instantly forwarded to your desintation address.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, you may include an address you control to collect processing fees as part of your own service. The processing fee can be either a fixed fee in satoshis or a percentage of the whole amount. The mining fee will always be perceived on the processing fee (if large enough). Here is an example POST request to create a payment collecting a 10% fee:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">POST https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/payments
{
  "destination": "15qx9ug952GWGTNn7Uiv6vode4RcGrRemh",
  "callback_url": "https://my.domain.com/callbacks/new-block"
  "process_fees_address": "1LWw6FdzNUcX8bnekMMZ7eofcGF7SXmbrL",
  "process_fees_percent": 0.1,
  "token": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
}</code></pre>
